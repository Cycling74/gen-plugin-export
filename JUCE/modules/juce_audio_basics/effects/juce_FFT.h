/**
    A very minimal FFT class.

    This is only a simple low-footprint implementation and isn't tuned for speed - it may
    be useful for simple applications where one of the more complex FFT libraries would be
    overkill. (But in the future it may end up becoming optimised of course...)

    The FFT class itself contains lookup tables, so there's some overhead in creating
    one, you should create and cache an FFT object for each size/direction of transform
    that you need, and re-use them to perform the actual operation.
