Please include:

  1) detailed steps on how to reproduce the bug, preferably with already
     existing JUCE code such as the demo plugin or the demo code
  2) the expected behaviour
  3) the operating system
  4) the architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
  5) a stack trace - if the bug causes a crash
  6) the plugin format (VST2, VST3, AU, AAX, RTAS) - if applicable
  7) which DAW you observed the bug in - if applicable

Make sure you have pulled the latest commits from the `develop` branch of the
JUCE repo and have re-compiled the Projucer before you submit your bug. Often
we have already fixed the issue but it hasn't yet been released on the `master`
branch. If it's a major bug, which must be hot-fixed immediately, then we will
also accept bug reports for tagged release versions.
