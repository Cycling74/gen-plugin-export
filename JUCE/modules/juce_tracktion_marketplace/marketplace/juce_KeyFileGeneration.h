{
public:
    /**
        Generates the content of a key-file which can be sent to a user's machine to
        unlock a product.

        The returned value is a block of text containing an RSA-encoded block, followed
        by some human-readable details. If you pass this block of text to
        OnlineUnlockStatus::applyKeyFile(), it will decrpyt it, and if the
        key matches and the machine numbers match, it will unlock that machine.

        Typically the way you'd use this on a server would be to build a small executable
        that simply calls this method and prints the result, so that the webserver can
        use this as a reply to the product's auto-registration mechanism. The
        keyGenerationAppMain() function is an example of how to build such a function.
