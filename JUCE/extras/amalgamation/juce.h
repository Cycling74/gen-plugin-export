    PLEASE NOTE! This file is just here to help transition old code to the newer
    modularised layout - but it will be removed at some point in the future, so
    you should update your projects to use the newer design as soon as possible.

    Now that the library has been broken up into separate modules, instead of
    including one giant header that includes everything, you should include the
    headers of the modules that you want to use. By far the easiest way to do that
    is with the introjucer, which will sort everything out for you and create a
    single header for your app which correctly includes everything you need.
