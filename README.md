BUILDING PLUGINS AND APPLICATIONS WITH GEN AND JUCE
===================================================

This is an example project that should help you get started with building your own plugins and iOS apps with the help of the code-export feature of [gen~](https://docs.cycling74.com/max7/maxobject/gen~), part of [Max 7](https://cycling74.com/max7/) made by [Cycling '74](https://cycling74.com/).

It is based on the JUCE Framework. Please be aware that the Juce library has its own license terms (mostly GPL with the availability of commercial licenses). See their website for further details:

<http://www.juce.com/>

Some information about the structure of this example:

| file/dir | explanation |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| build-result/ 				| this is where the result of the builds (the VST or AU plugins) are stored |
| exported-code					| the folder where gen~ will export the code to |
| CoreAudioUtilityClasses		| needed for building Audio Units - see below for more info |
| gen-example.maxpat			| a Max patcher outlining the process to build a plugin |
| Introjucer    				| Introjucer files - define the plugin behavior |
| JUCE					        | the Juce framework - do not touch |
| post-export.py                | post export script - triggered by code export, will build your plugin |
| README.md 					| this file |
| Source-App/					| the source for your iOS Application, feel free to edit those (includes sample UI) |
| Source-Plugin/				| the source for your Audio Plugins, feel free to edit those |

**auto generated folders and files**

| file/dir | explanation |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| App-Builds/					| generated by Introjucer, will hold all iOS projects |
| AU-Builds/ 					| generated by Introjucer, will hold all AudioIUnit projects |
| VST-Builds/					| generated by Introjucer, will hold all VST projects |
| VST3-Builds/ 					| generated by Introjucer, will hold all VST3 projects |

Prerequisites
-------------

**Mac OS X**

- download and install Xcode from the AppStore (this Readme has been made with Xcode 6.3)
- to build AudioUnits you need to copy the folder CoreAudio (you find it inside of the folder CoreAudioUtilityClasses) into the directory /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Extras/ (create it if needed)

	it should look like:

	/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Extras/CoreAudio

- building VSTs requires the VST SDK from <http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html>
  at the time of writing this is VST 3.6.5 which is capable of building VST2 and VST 3

	install it into ~/SDKs/VST3 SDK

**Windows**

- download and install Visual Studio 2013 Express Desktop from <https://www.visualstudio.com>

- building VSTs requires the VST SDK from http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html
  at the time of writing this is VST 3.6.0 which is capable of building VST2 and VST 3

	install it into c:\SDKs\VST3 SDK

- for running the post export python script you need to install Python from <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>


Build
-----

open the example patcher [gen-example.maxpat](https://github.com/Cycling74/gen-plugin-export/blob/master/gen-example.maxpat) included in this repository and follow the instructions in the patcher.

for more instructions on how to customize your plugin please visit: <http://www.juce.com/>

note: all provided projects have been created via the Introjucer, so it should be safe to use the Introjucer to edit them (for example, to add or change a UI).


Adding a GUI, changing settings etc.
------------------------------------

plugin building is based on the JUCE Framework:

<http://www.juce.com/>

- if you want to add or remove files from your Xcode or Visual Studio project, do not
  edit the projects directly (they will be rebuilt on each export), but use the
  Introjucer files in the root folder
- in the folder Introjucer/ you will find a program called "Introjucer", this
  program is used to edit those ".jucer" files, for example "C74-Gen-VSTPlugin.jucer",
  which also offer more advanced ways of plugin configuration
- you can also use the introjucer to add a UI, an example of this can be found in the
  Introjucer file "C74-Gen-Application.jucer" (the iOS Project). Find a quick introduction to the tool here: <http://www.juce.com/learn/introjucer>

Enjoy!
