/**
    An AudioFormat class which can use an installed version of the LAME mp3
    encoder to encode a file.

    This format can't read MP3s, it just writes them. Internally, the
    AudioFormatWriter object that is returned writes the incoming audio data
    to a temporary WAV file, and then when the writer is deleted, it invokes
    the LAME executable to convert the data to an MP3, whose data is then
    piped into the original OutputStream that was used when first creating
    the writer.
