/**
    An implementation of the OnlineUnlockStatus class which talks to the
    Tracktion Marketplace server.

    For details about how to use this class, see the docs for the base
    class: OnlineUnlockStatus. Basically, you need to inherit from it, and
    implement all the pure virtual methods to tell it about your product.
