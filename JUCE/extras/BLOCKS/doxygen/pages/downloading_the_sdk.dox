/**
@page downloading_the_sdk Downloading the SDK

The BLOCKS SDK is distributed as part of the <a href="https://www.juce.com/">JUCE framework</a>, which can be obtained from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE">here</a>.
The JUCE repository also contains the code for the @ref example_applications, which require the JUCE framework to compile.
Whilst you don't need to know anything about JUCE to build the examples using the supplied Visual Studio/Xcode/etc projects, it will probably be worthwhile reading a brief introduction to JUCE, which can be found <a href="https://www.juce.com/learn/getting-started">here</a>.

You can also download the standalone BLOCKS SDK from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/WeAreROLI/BLOCKS-SDK">here</a>.
This is a stripped down version of what JUCE provides, including only the features required for the SDK.
Using this version of the SDK is much more complicated but may be more suitable for integrating BLOCKS into an existing application.
More details are provided in the @ref the_standalone_blocks_sdk section.
